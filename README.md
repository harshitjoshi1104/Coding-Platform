# About The Coding Platform

This is a Webapp I've created as my college level minor project. This website helps students who want to prepare for technical interviews but are not able to find right material for preparation. Interview Oriented Questions are provided in the website along with the frequency count.

## Available Pages

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Home or Explore Page`

This is the Home page of the website which simply has a Heading stating stating what website does and some navigation bar to browse other sections of the website.

### `Problems Page`

This page contains the list of all the questions (right now approx 20-25). Status is also provided along with the questions so authenticated user can see what all questions they have already done. Along with this 'Accuracy' is also provided stating the difficulty of the questions, Frequency count is also given to each question, this represents how many times this question is asked in an interview in recent 5 years. There are links for several study cards are also provided so user can learn the required topics of data structures and algorithm

### `Study Card`

These Cards helps user to grasp a good amount of understanding in certein topics like Dynamic Programming , or Binary Search etc. All necessay details about the topic is provided in the card along with the Questions to practice.

### `Question Page`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
