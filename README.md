# About The Coding Platform

This is a Webapp I've created as my college level minor project. This website helps students who want to prepare for technical interviews but are not able to find right material for preparation. Interview Oriented Questions are provided in the website along with the frequency count.

## Available Pages

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Home or Explore Page`

This is the Home page of the website which simply has a Heading stating stating what website does and some navigation bar to browse other sections of the website.

### `Problems Page`

This page contains the list of all the questions (right now approx 20-25). Status is also provided along with the questions so authenticated user can see what all questions they have already done. Along with this 'Accuracy' is also provided stating the difficulty of the questions, Frequency count is also given to each question, this represents how many times this question is asked in an interview in recent 5 years. There are links for several study cards are also provided so user can learn the required topics of data structures and algorithm

### `Study Card`

These Cards helps user to grasp a good amount of understanding in certein topics like Dynamic Programming , or Binary Search etc. All necessay details about the topic is provided in the card along with the Questions to practice.

### `Question Page`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

This Page contains the Questions and Description:
1) Questions Description:- Stating the Problem.
3) Examples :- Some Outputs are provided corresponding to the some input examples.
4) Questions Details:- Details tab is also provided so user can know Difficulty level of the questions, category of the question , companies it is asked in etc.
5) Average Timer:- Average Time is also provided for every question, reason being interviews are time specific, the moment we open a question the timer starts, of-                   course we have infinite time to solve the question but solving it in specified average time will give you an idea of your understanding of the topics.
6) Integerated Compiler:- An integerated Compiler is also provided for three Different languages ( **Python, C++, Java** ) user can code in any of these languages and               run the code by either inputing some variables or leave the input field blank and can run the Code. Compiler will send the code and language to backend                 where it will run the code and produce output accordingly and send it back to frontend. The timebound of 8 sec is also applied so it will produce TLE if               code has infinite loops.
7) Submitting Code :- You can run code endlessly but once you submit the code (authentication is must) the code will run on the hidden testcases and if it is able to                 pass all the test cases it will produce the All Correct (AC) response and save that questions status as completed in the users database. If it fails any               of the hidden test case it will produce wrong answer.
